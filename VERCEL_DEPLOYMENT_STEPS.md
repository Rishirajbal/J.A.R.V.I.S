# Step-by-Step Vercel Deployment Guide

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for deploying the J.A.R.V.I.S. Interface to Vercel.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

1. Ensure your repository has the following structure:
   ```
   J.A.R.V.I.S/
   ├── public/
   │   ├── index.html
   │   ├── css/
   │   │   └── style.css
   │   └── js/
   │       └── script.js
   ├── package.json
   └── vercel.json
   ```

2. Verify that all files are properly linked in your HTML:
   - CSS: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/style.css">`
   - JS: `<script src="/js/script.js"></script>`

## Step 2: Create a Vercel Account

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up for an account (you can use GitHub, GitLab, or email)
3. Complete the onboarding process

## Step 3: Install Vercel CLI

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

## Step 4: Login to Vercel

```bash
vercel login
```

Follow the prompts to complete the login process.

## Step 5: Deploy Your Project

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/J.A.R.V.I.S
   ```

2. Run the deployment command:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. Answer the configuration questions:
   - Set up and deploy? `Y`
   - Select your scope (personal account or team)
   - Link to existing project? `N`
   - Project name: `jarvis-interface` (or your preferred name)
   - Directory location: `./` (press Enter)
   - Override settings? `N`

4. Wait for the deployment to complete

## Step 6: Deploy to Production

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## Step 7: Access Your Deployed Site

1. Vercel will provide a URL for your deployment (e.g., `jarvis-interface.vercel.app`)
2. Open this URL in your browser
3. Grant camera and microphone permissions when prompted

## Step 8: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to the Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Settings" > "Domains"
4. Add your custom domain and follow the instructions

## Step 9: Update Your Deployment (When Making Changes)

1. Make your changes to the code
2. Commit the changes to your repository
3. If you've connected your GitHub repository to Vercel, it will automatically redeploy
4. If using the CLI, run `vercel --prod` again to update your deployment

## Troubleshooting

- If your deployment fails, check the Vercel logs for specific error messages
- Ensure all file paths in your HTML are correct (should start with `/`)
- Verify that your `vercel.json` configuration is correct
- Check that all required dependencies are listed in your `package.json`
